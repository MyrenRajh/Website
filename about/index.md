Hi, I'm Myren Rajh and I am a Mechanical Engineer with a passion for Computational Mechanics, Finite Element Analysis (FEM), Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), Optimisation and Deep Learning.

I am currently completing my Master's Degree in Mechanical Engineering at the University of Pretoria with a research focus on *Learning Discrete Numerical Differential Operators from Data*.

 Prior to my current studies, I completed both a Honours and Undergraduate Degree in Mechanical Engineering where I focused my modules to specialise in 

- Computational Fluid Dynamics and Thermo-flow
- Advanced Non-linear Finite Element Methods
- Deep Learning and Deep Graph Learning
- Bayesian Inference, Statistical and Machine Learning
- Engineering Optimisation

My undergraduate studies allowed me to gain experience in applying deep learning for solving inverse problems in engineering, and in particular, performing material and geometric parameter estimation from vibration measurements. I also have some experience in the design of wet cooling towers which I acquired when completing my final year design project.
