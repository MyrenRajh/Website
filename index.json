In my Honours and Undergraduate degrees in Mechanical Engineering, I specialised in Optimisation Advanced Nonlinear Finite Element Methods Computational Fluid Dynamics (Finite Difference and Finite Volume Methods) Bayesian Inference, Statistical and Machine Learning Deep Learning and Deep Graph Learning As part of my Undergraduate degree I have experience in applying deep learning for solving inverse problems such as material parameter estimation and also designing and optimising wet cooling towers. In my free time I enjoy reading and programming mini-projects involving CFD solvers, deep learning models, learning about HPC and some video-gaming.
