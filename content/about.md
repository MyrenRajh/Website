## A Brief Introduction
<!-- ![portrait](portrait.jpeg) -->
My name is Myren Rajh and I am a Mechanical Engineer with a passion for

- Computational Mechanics (Structural and Fluids)
- Deep Learning
- Optimisation

I am currently enrolled for a Masters in Mechanical Engineering at the University of Pretoria with a research focus in applying interpretable deep learning and graph neural networks to computational mechanics and engineering simulations. In my Honours and Undergraduate degrees in Mechanical Engineering, I specialised in

- Optimisation
- Advanced Nonlinear Finite Element Methods
- Computational Fluid Dynamics (Finite Difference and Finite Volume Methods)
- Bayesian Inference, Statistical and Machine Learning
- Deep Learning and Deep Graph Learning

As part of my Undergraduate degree I have experience in applying deep learning for solving inverse problems such as material parameter estimation and also designing and optimising wet cooling towers. 

In my free time I enjoy reading and programming mini-projects involving CFD solvers, deep learning models, learning about HPC and some video-gaming.
